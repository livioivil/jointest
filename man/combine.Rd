\title{(nonparametric) combination of jointest object}
\usage{
combine(mods, comb_funct = "maxT", combined = NULL, by = NULL, tail = 0)
}
\arguments{
\item{mods}{object of class \code{jointest} (it can be a list of glm or flipscores converted in a \code{jointest} object using \code{as.jointest})}

\item{comb_funct}{Combining function to be used. Several functions are implemented: "mean", "median", "Fisher", "Liptak", (equal to) "Stoufer", "Tippet", (equal to) "minp", "maxT" (the default). 
Alternativelly it can be a custom function that has a matrix as input. The function return a vector of length equal to the number of rows of the input matrix.}

\item{combined}{a) if \code{NULL} it combines all coefficients with the same names along models, 
b) if a vector of characters, it gives a combination for each stats with these names}

\item{by}{vector of characters referring to the column's name in summary_table. Equal to "Coeff" by default.}

\item{tail}{direction of the alternative hypothesis. It can be "two.sided" (or 0, the default), "less" (or -1) or "greater" (or +1)}
}
